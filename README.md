AndroidLetsMeet
===============

Mobile application that allows user to schedule meetings and share their availability.

This is version 0.1 of LetsMeet. We plan to have an initial Android prototype with the following features:
- Allow users to sync their availability based on their google calendar or iCal information. 
- Allow a user to share their availability by automatically generating an email with the user's availabilty or
by allowing him/her to schedule a meeting  with his/her contacts
- Let the user receive requests to submit availability and let the user see a list of meeting in which he/she
is participating.

We also want to have an alpha web prototype with the following features:
- Using a link, that represents an invitation to schedule a meeting, allows the user to sync their calendar information
and allow the user edit and submit it to the meeting.
